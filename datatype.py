#python can understand the data type without variable declaration
#'+' sign denotes to concatenation, only strings can be concatenated
#python is strict about indentation 

#List: List is nothing but array we can use square [] brackets to hold list, This is Mutable → We can modify its contents

#Tuple: This is similar to List but uses small bracket () to hold values ,It’s Immutable → you can’t modify original content as tuple doesn’t support assignment operator

#Dictionary: We use it to store key value pair like Map in Java ,It uses curly brackets {}
